 			    <h1>Welcome to the Golden Gate City <small>10th April 2015</small></h1>
			  </div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-9">
			  <p>Good morning world! I’ve been in San Francisco for 2 weeks now, and for about a week and a half of that I’ve been thinking "I really need to write all of this stuff down", so here it goes. To break up the monotony of my writing, I’ve interspersed headings from Mean Girls that are semi relevant to what I’m talking about. </p>
			  <p>Getting over here was surprisingly easy. I flew with United, and contrary to popular belief, the flight was actually quite pleasant. I sat next to this kindly old couple, who would give me ‘did-you-just-see-that’ side glances when carry-on luggage would fall out of the overhead compartments and when the flight attendants got angry and had dummy spits. They were very sweet, coming over to visit their daughter and grandkids (they come over for 52 days at a time, so it’s like they’ve seen them once a week for a whole year). </p>
			  <p>When I got to San Francisco, the train system into the city was breezey (I did have to ask for help from the attendant, but when I explained that English was my second language, they completely understood). I ended up exiting the train at what felt like a particularly dodgy area, so I treated myself to an $11 cab ride for the rest of my journey (don’t worry, I had a glass of water for dinner to subsidise the cost... </p>
			  <p>...well not quite, but almost). </p>
			  <h3>I'm a new student here. My name is Cady Heron.</h3>
			  <p>From the moment I stepped out into the crazy world that is this bizarre city, I have felt like I am 5 years old again. It’s like I sort of recognise everything, but I have to re-learn things ‘the American way’. Or at least ‘the San Franciscan Way’.</p>
			  <p>First example – dogs. Growing up with a mother who wasn’t overly fond of the beasts, I believed that I had a well-founded understanding of where dogs do and do not belong (and my brother’s Doberman that’s currently sleeping on my mothers’ prized couch is an example of where they <em>don’t</em> belong). I probably also thought that dogs don’t belong in places like restaurants, pharmacies and banks. However, it turns out that I am incorrect about all of these assumptions. Here, it’s quite reasonable to bring your dog anywhere you like, including into food establishments and even <em>nightclubs</em>. Any I’m not talking about seeing eye-dogs, or drug sniffing beagles. These are everything from Chihuahua’s to St Bernard’s, and everything in between! </p>
			  <p>Second example – people here like to talk to each other. I’m not talking in a ‘friends get together and chat’ sort of way. People here will get on the train, and regularly strike up a conversation with a total stranger, and they will talk the whole way between their stops. If someone started talking to me on public transport back home, without asking me a specific question, I’d swear I was either being hit on or mugged. I actually really like that, but it’s still taking time to adjust to it. </p>
			  <p>Third example – the non-judgemental, totally bizarre spirit of the city. In my first few days here, I saw people wearing bright green and purple tutus, people wearing nothing but a sock on their genitals, and men strutting down the street in high heels so tall, that if one broke, they’d have time to curse all the gods of fashion before they hit the ground. And what did all of these things have in common? Not one person looked twice at these people. There was no sniggering, no staring, no whispering. Everyone went about their day as if these people were wearing business suits, no hassles at all. And coming from a fairly conservative country, I found this both incredibly different and incredibly encouraging. It’s amazing to see a place with such acceptance for people outside of the norm, and I feel blessed to be able to live in such a place (regardless for how long I’m here for). </p>
			  <h3>We’re your friends</h3>
			  <p>One thing that has made the set-up in San Francisco much easier is that I had some wonderful friends who have helped me immensely over the past fortnight. (Fun fact: Most people in the US have never heard of the term ‘fortnight’ before!). I stayed with my friends Dan and Erick for the first 5 nights of being here, and then my friend Will for the next 3 nights. These guys went above and beyond in helping me when I got here, and I’m incredibly grateful for their generosity.</p>
			  <p>Along with the fabulous boys who helped me when I got over here, I’ve already made several new friends since being here. Between Tom (former ANU student), Jack (a guy who’s coming to Sydney for a month, so I’m taking his room) all of Dan and Erick’s friends that I’ve met and everyone else (of which there are many), people have really been wonderful to me.</p>
			  <p>They’ve helped put me in touch with people in the IT industry, shown me around the city and even introduced me to The Castro. The Castro is a magical place that don’t measure their drinks, play showtunes in bars and has a never ending supply of forgiveness when it comes to young Australians who can’t handle their alcohol very well. </p>
			  <h3>Is there alcohol in this? Oh, God, honey, no. What kind of mother do you think I am?!</h3>
			  <p>So there’s an alcohol culture here. Firstly, bartenders don’t have to worry about the nuisance of measuring their drinks, which invariably means the drinks are much stronger. Also, people just seem to drink <em>more</em>. Which is ok, but as someone who hasn’t got a high tolerance for alcohol (physically speaking) and has no need to drive in this city, I’ve had to become more assertive when it comes to saying no to drinking. It’s just so easy to become drunk here, and once I cross that threshold, it becomes a bad time for everyone! So after a week of silliness (then a week of being run down with a cold), I think I’m beginning to find my thresholds.</p>
			  <h3>You remember your phone number? I wrote it down for you, just in case.</h3>
			  <p>One interesting observation comes from not having internet on my phone for the first week of being here. International data charges meant that I had to have roaming switched off, and since I had to still get around the city, it meant having to source a physical map of the city (thanks Dan) and actually navigate myself around. The thing was though, after about one day of not having my phone, I actually began to function like a ‘normal’ person again. I didn’t have Facebook on the train, so I sat there and listened, or I read a book. An actual book! I love to read, and I suddenly had all of this time that I could just sit there and read! It was wonderful. I also had nothing to distract me as I walked around the city, so I found myself far more immersed in my surroundings than I usually am. It was truly fantastic. Unfortunately, the internet is too much of a crutch, so I’ve got it back now, but I’m trying to keep it in my pocket as much as I can. </p>
			  <h3>She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.</h3>
			  <p>So, until I get a job, I’m doing this trip on a shoestring budget. I’m still having lots of experiences, but I’m also trying to stretch my money out as far as I possibly can. For the most part, that hasn’t been too terrible (I’m staying in a travellers hostel at the moment with free breakfast and WiFi, so I’m riding that wave as far as I can), but America, there’s something we need to talk about. </p>
			  <p>Not displaying the price you have to pay. </p>
			  <p>Seriously.</p>
			  <p>What the hell is that all about?! </p>
			  <p>Everytime you get to a register, they add ‘tax’ on (as if giving you the heads up on the original price tag might mean that you don’t buy the item!?). Then sometimes you have a 3% charge for employees health care. Then, if it’s a food or service place, you add 20% <em>on top</em> of all that for a tip?! By the time you pay, you’re not even in the same ballpark as when you started! It’s really, really annoying America, and I’d like you to get your act together.</p>
			  <p>I did find someone to cut my hair for $10 in Chinatown though, so that was pretty exciting for me... </p>
			  <h3>Hey. How was your first day?</h3>
			  <p>So all in all, I’ve had an extremely positive start to this journey. This blog has only scraped the surface of what the past 2 weeks have been like, but to include it all would require another 50 pages of writing. I’ve definitely had some shocks when it comes to the type of work that’s being done here in the IT industry, but it just means I have to step up my game. The stress that comes with looking for work has been a great motivator, and I’ve already done some cool techy things, which I’ll be sure to brag about if I get an interview anywhere! No one here seems concerned about my job prospects though, so that’s encouraging. </p>
			  <p>Still no place to live, but I’ve got accommodation sorted through til the 26ths of May. Hopefully by then I’ll have a job <em>somewhere</em>, and if not, I’ll take whatever living arrangements I can get. </p>
			  <p>As for everything else, I’ll take it as it comes! This trip has already tested me in keeping cool when unexpected things happen, and being willing to change the plan if necessary. I feel so blessed to be here right now, and the plan is to make the most of it. I’m missing everyone back home, but I know I’ll see them all again before too long. Right now, it’s time to be like a young, living, Walt Disney, and Keep Moving Forward. </p>
